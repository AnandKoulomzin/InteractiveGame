In this game orange squares are falling from the sky and you, controlling an arrow at the bottom of the screen, have to dodge them.
The squares progressively get faster and the arrow moves closer to them, but the gaps in the squares remain allowing the arrow to weave through them.
The user also has three stops that they can use that momentarily stop the squares from moving allowing them a couple of seconds to catch up.
